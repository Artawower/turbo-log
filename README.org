* Turbo log - fast logging selected line or region
This project inspired by similar package for [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log][vs-code - turbo-console-log]], and provided functionality for fast log message inserting under current line.
It works for *js-mode, typescript-mode, go-mode and python*.
** How it works?
[[./images/sample.gif]]
** Installation
Now /turbo-log/ is not available from MELPA. Your can install it with quelpa or another package manager:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package turbo-log
  :quelpa (turbo-log :fetcher github :repo "Artawower/turbo-log.el")
  :bind (("C-s-l" . turbo-log-print)
         ("C-s-h" . turbo-log-comment-all-logs)
         ("C-s-s" . turbo-log-uncomment-all-logs)
         ("C-s-d" . turbo-log-delete-all-logs))
  :config
  (setq turbo-console--prefix "âœ°"))
  #+END_SRC
  /doom/
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! turbo-log :recipe (:host github :repo "artawower/turbo-log"))
  #+END_SRC

** Customisation
- =turbo-log-prefix= Special prefix, will put [line number][buffer-name?] <here>
- =turbo-log--include-buffer-name= If true will put buffer name to log message
** Plans
+ [X] Typescript support
+ [X] Javascript support
+ [X] Python support
+ [X] Golang support
+ [ ] Improve insert position finding
+ [X] Comment/uncomment all log messages that were made by package.
