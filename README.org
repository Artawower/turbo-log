* Turbo log - fast log selected line or region
This project inspired by similar package for [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log][vs-code - turbo-console-log]], and provided functionality for fast log message inserting under current line.
It works for *js-mode, typescript-mode, go-mode and python*.
** How it works?

Now /turbo-log/ is not available from MELPA. Your can install it with quelpa or another package manager:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package turbo-log
    :quelpa (turbo-log :fetcher github :repo "Artawower/turbo-log.el")
    :bind (:map global-map ("C-s-l" . turbo-log-print))
    :config
    (setq turbo-console--prefix "âœ°"))
#+END_SRC
